# mathle


helper program to solve mathle

There are three python modules:

    mathle_solution_generator.py : A program to generate all the possible solutions and create the script of a python dictionary that contains all solutions. 

    mathledict.py : contains the dictionary created by mathle_solution_generator.py. This dictionary is imported by mathle_helper.py

    mathle_helper.py : a script to calculate the best option for the next line based on the lines entered so far

The solution generator makes a few assumptions about what constitutes a valid solution:

    none of the components of the equation is zero
